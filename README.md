# ðŸš¦ LifeStatus

**LifeStatus** is a personal progress dashboard that tracks your goals and tasks
with a system status page approach. Monitor your daily, weekly, or custom
cadence goals with real-time status updates, helping you stay accountable and on
track.

[**Read the blog post**](https://cedthe.dev/blog/public-accountability) to learn
about the inspiration behind the project and get a high-level overview of how it
works.

## Minimum Viable Product

- Users should be able to add monitors, tracking goals with a defined frequency
  and cadence.
- Users should be able to view the status of individual monitors.
- Users should be able to record updates for monitors.
- Users should be able to see the overall aggregate status of all monitors.

## Future Enhancements

- Users should be able to see the historical status of each monitors for up to
  the past 90 days.
- Users should be able to see recent update activity (e.g. over the last 24
  hours, max 10 updates).

## Learning Objectives

- Gain experience in rapid development and focus on prioritizing essential
  features to meet a tight deadline.
- Enhance proficiency with TypeScript, particularly in building and managing
  back-end services using the Express.js framework.
- Strengthen database management by using the `sqlite3` package to interact with
  SQLite and focus on optimizing query performance.
- Explore Redis for caching, with an emphasis on minimizing redundant
  computations and improving overall system efficiency.
- Develop the ability to effectively explain technical decisions, challenges,
  and outcomes for purposes such as job interviews, blog posts, etc.
- Utilize Docker to simplify dependency management and streamline the deployment
  process across different environments.
